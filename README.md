# EARS33: Earth Surface Processes and Landforms
This is from a geomorphology course that was taught at Dartmouth College and now at William and Mary College by Dr. Joanmarie Del Vecchio. This repository contains data tutorial activities and associated files. It also contains a showcase of student coding projects. 

## Students do the following to get started
Instructions for students on how to operate jupyter for class activity:

1. The URL is: https://jupyterhub.fandm.edu:8000/hub/login
    The username is your netID and the password you use to access your college google email. 

2. In order to get the labs from github (you only have to do this one time):
- Open a terminal (at bottom left of screen) 
- Create a new folder by selecting the new folder icon in the top left of your screen
- Name the folder "GeomJupyter"
- In the terminal, type "cd G" and hit the tab key. Press enter.
- At the prompt type: "git clone https://github.com/DorothyMerritts/ears226.git "
        and press enter. This will copy all of Joan Marie's files
- Select your GeomJupyter folder on the left > ears33 > jhub_data_tutorials > DT1_Intro_to_Python,...
- Read through instructions and begin.

## Old content. Just for reference. Do not do this. For installing locally [Forked from Joanmarie's GitHub]
The 2022 notebooks can run on Colab, but Joanmarie is switching to Dartmouth's Jupyter Hub for Spring 2023. We can still download and run these notebooks locally, however:
1. If you don't have a Python distribution, Joanmarie recommends installing `miniconda` but `Anaconda` works too. 
2. Download the files via `git clone https://github.com/jmdelvecchio/ears33.git`
3. Use Anaconda Prompt or however you're going about this coding world to install the `ears33` environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml` and then `conda activate ears33`. This has the potential to take a while. 
4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks.
